## What I First Learned ##
The first time I learned python was in 6th grade in an online python programming camp taught by a group of high schoolers. There I learned the basics.<br><br>
**Stuff like**<br>
* Datatypes<br>
* Operations<br>
* Methods<br>
* Classes<br>
* Inheritance<br>
* Ursina module<br>

## What Else I Now Know ##
Throught the years since I have learned alot more python, but I realy need to focus on an area.<br><br>
* Numpy<br>
* Pandas<br>
* Tensorflow/Keras(Mostly taught me how to debug downloads)<br>
* Comprehensions<br>
* Flask<br>
* How to use APIs<br>
* Lambda Expressions<br>
* *Args and **kwargs<br>
* In general, a better grasp of Python and debugging<br>

## Why I think I should take AP Computer Science Principles ##


Despite some person saying that some teacher said that freshman should not be allowed to take AP Computer Science Principles, I still belive I should take it.

1. My biggest weakness is that I can not find a field to build expertise in and the course focuses on applications of coding such as simulations or the internet.

2. I already know python, so it will make learning pseudo code easier and the python part of the course easier.

3. I have the effort and the abilty to go through this advanced course. Even if there is some very dificult project or assignment, I can power through it even if it takes 12 hours to finish it. Also, I am top of my class, so I believe I can acomplish this course.
